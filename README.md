# Lightweight-vs.-Heavyweight-Virtualization-Techniques

•	Google Cloud instance as Native

•	Docker (a light-weight,container-based virtualization technique) with detailed configurations and installation steps, performance tests(CPU Utilization, I/O throughput, disk utilization)

•	QEMU (a user-level full virtualization technique) with OS configurations, detailed installation steps and performance tests(CPU Utilization, I/O throughput, latency)


Measured the performance using benchmarks(sysbench, iostat), and finally compare the results in a report
